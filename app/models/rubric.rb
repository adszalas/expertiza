# This is one type of Questionnaire and  as intuitively expected this model class
# derives from Questionnaire.

# This implements Rubric(type) specific model methods ( Rubric does not have any type specific 
# functionality). These methods are invoked when called by any activeRecord object(row) of 
# questionnaires table with type 'Rubric'  

class  Rubric < Questionnaire
    # for doc on why we do it this way,

    # can these be inherited too?
